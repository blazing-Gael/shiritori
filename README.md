Shiritori Game
attempted by Anannyo Hridi Deep

gonna admit I was sloppy after not coding for a while and not using AI. I couldn't fix all the bugs but did try implementing all the features. Good Experience.
Pray I get better and finally get a job!
Assalamualaikum.

I used a card component twice for the two players.
No backend implemented.
Player turn and the last character is shared between the component through props. Not at all how it should be! using a state  manager or context provider would have been much better.
rest seems okay.
Oh, forgot about the timer.
Thank you for your time.
